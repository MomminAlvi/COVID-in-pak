# COVID-in-pak
A fun little project i did to pass my time while the lockdown was on.
when executed this code creates an excel file in which there are multiple sheets for all the provinces in pakistan and a sheet name pakistan.
the sheets contain the date at which the code was executed, the active cases, recovered cases and total cases for the respective sheet.
if the file i.e master.xlsx already exists, it just adds the new row to all sheets.
hope you enjoy this project!
